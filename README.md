# pico-cs firmware

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/pico-cs/firmware)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/pico-cs/firmware)

pico-cs is a proof-of-concept for a model railway command station talking DCC (Digital Command Control) defined by the [NMRA DCC working group](https://www.nmra.org/dcc-working-group) and using the [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) as DCC signal generator.

pico-cs is intended for skilled users with expert levels of model railway electronics and protocol knowledge.

## Why Raspberry Pi Pico / Pico W

- Its support of programmable IO (PIO) enables implementing the core DCC protocol within a few lines of assembler code
- Due to its dual cores the DCC signal generation and the command interface are implemented using different cores being run in parallel
- Its small form factor and cost effectiveness allows and supports multiple command stations to be used as part of the model railroad layout
- Its great ducumentation 
- The Pico W WiFi capabilities to operate the command station remotely via a TCP/IP connection
- And last but not least the fun using it

## Hardware

- Raspberry Pi Pico / Pico W
- A PC, Laptop, Raspberry Pi or any suitable device with an USB interface to flash the firmware and operate the command station via serial over USB and / or WiFi
- A model railway booster
- A model railroad locomotive roller test stand
- A DCC decoder equiped test locomotive

### Booster

As there is a lot of booster alternatives (motor shield, H-bridge, commercial booster, ...) the selection and connection options to the Pico goes beyond the scope of this document. You might find potential solutions searching the internet.

Voltage levels:
- Pico DCC signal output is on GP2 with 3.3V level
- As most digital booster DCC inputs would not work with 3.3V (please consult booster documentation) one need to choose a safe and reliable solution for level conversion
- Example with SN74HCT125N as level shifter ([Fritzing circuit diagram](https://fritzing.org))

### DCC decoder

Please be aware that not all DCC decoders do support all of the DCC commands. The pico-cs command station is using the DCC commands which most standard compliant DCC decoders should be able to understand. Nonetheless some decoders 
- do have issues with main track programming
- do behave weird in case functions are used not supported by the decoder or writing CVs in general

**Please be cautious and test all loco decoders on a roller test stand before using on track.**

To mitigate some of the function setting issues the pico-cs command station is only refreshing functions which were explicitly used via the protocol.

## Quick Start

- Connect the Raspberry Pi Pico to your PC via an USB cable
- [Build](#build) the pico-cs firmware
- Install firmware (Pico: cs.uf2, Pico W: cs_w.uf2) via BOOTSEL mode (see [Raspberry Pi Pico documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html))
- On macOS Ventura copying via drag&drop in Finder was broken but seems to work again with version 13.1 - anyway, copying the file via the command line is always an option:
```
cp -X cs.uf2 /Volumes/RPI-RP2/
cp -X cs_w.uf2 /Volumes/RPI-RP2/
``` 
- Use a terminal emulation tool supporting serial over USB communication like
  - the Serial Monotor of the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) or
  - the [Serial Monitor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-serial-monitor) extension of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Set the baud rate to 115200 and \<CR\> (Carriage Return) as command / message ending character
- The firmware uses the following Raspberry Pi Pico GPIOs:
  - GP2: DCC signal output
  - GP3: DCC signal output (inverted)
  - GP4: DCC signal power
  - GP5: DCC signal power  (inverted)

## Build

For building there is two options available:

- [local build](#local): install the toolchain and build on your local machine
- [docker build](https://github.com/pico-cs/docker-buld): no toolchain installation but a running docker environment on your local machine is required

### Local

To build the firmware the Raspberry Pi Pico C/C++ SDK and toolchain needs to be installed. For details please consult the [Raspberry Pi Pico documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html).

As the binary for the Pico W including the WiFi and network capabilities is significant larger and the WiFi SSID and a WiFi password is needed two firmware versions are build:

```
git clone https://github.com/pico-cs/firmware.git
cd firmware/src
```

Pico:

```
mkdir pico_build
cd pico_build
cmake .. -DPICO_BOARD=pico
make
```
- firmware: cs.uf2 

Pico W:
```
export PICO_CS_WIFI_SSID="MyWifiName"
export PICO_CS_WIFI_PASSWORD="MyPassword"
export PICO_CS_TCP_PORT= 4242
mkdir pico_w_build
cd pico_w_build
cmake .. -DPICO_BOARD=pico_w
make
```
- if the TCP_PORT environment varible (PICO_CS_TCP_PORT) is not set the default port 4242 is used.
- firmware: cs_w.uf2
